First we can see that the file is a disk image.

I used autopsy to analyze the disk image. We can see the file "flag.txt",  so I dumped it  :

![](/assets/img/2018/sectctf2018/shredder/3.png)

Now we have a file named "flag.txt" but it's not the flag. My first idea was to try with xortool :

```
xortool -b flag.txt
```

And I was right :


![](/assets/img/2018/sectctf2018/shredder/4.png)

And we got the flag :
