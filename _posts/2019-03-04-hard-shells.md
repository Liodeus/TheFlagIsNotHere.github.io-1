First, letâ€™s take a look at the file :

![](/assets/img/2018/icectf2018/hardshells/2.png)

It's a Zip archive, so try to unzip it :

![](/assets/img/2018/icectf2018/hardshells/3.png)

We need a password, I used john to crack it :

```
zip2john hardshells > hash
john hash
```

And we got the password :

Now we have a Minix file whose name "d", mount it :


```
mount -t minix d /mnt/test
```

And we have a new file "dat", if we look at the header with hexdump we suppose it's a .PNG but the header has been modified :

Use a hexeditor to modified the U(55 in hex) to N(4e in hex)

Now you can open it and read the flag :
