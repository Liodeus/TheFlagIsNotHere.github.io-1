Letâ€™s have a look at this note :

![](/assets/img/2018/securityfestctf2018/theoracle/2.png)

We have a gibberish note !

My first thought was to use xortool :

```
xortool -b emsg.txt
```
Go to the result folder, and search for the flag :

```
strings *|grep sctf{
```
![](/assets/img/2018/securityfestctf2018/theoracle/3.png)

That it we got it !
