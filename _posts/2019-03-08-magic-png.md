First let's take a look a these different files. I have one zip who contain a flag, but the zip ask for a password, and I have a picture who seems to be corrupt.

First I use hexyl to view the header of the corrupt picture

![](/assets/img/2019/pragyanctf/magicpng/2.png)

The header seems not be the good header for a png file, the correct header is :

```
89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 
```

With hexedit I changed the corrupt header by the good one.

I tried to open the picture but I get an error with "IDAT”. So I decided to compare the file with a good png to see what is the good header for the IDAT :

![](/assets/img/2019/pragyanctf/magicpng/4.png)

The left one is the good png, and the right one it the corrupt png. We can see that the IDAT header is not good. It should be :

```
00 20 00 49 44 41 54 78 
```

So I changed it with hexedit. Now I can open the picture :

![](/assets/img/2019/pragyanctf/magicpng/good_picture.png)

Let's unzip the zip file with the password : ```h4CK3RM4n```, but it's not the good password. The hint of the challenge may be of some help :

```
You may have to hash the secret word to get the flag...
```

I hashed the password with md5sum :

```bash
echo -n  "h4CK3RM4n" | md5sum
2c919f82ee2ed6985d5c5e275d67e4f8  -
```

Unzip the file with the hashed password :

```bash
unzip -P 2c919f82ee2ed6985d5c5e275d67e4f8 tryme.zip
Archive:  tryme.zip
 extracting: flag.txt                
```
